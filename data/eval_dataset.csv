Despite the differences in their treatment methods, both are proven to have equivalent outcomes for the patient. Dr. Smith, who is currently in charge, can either continue her own standard treatment yielding -9 benefit for herself and 0 for Dr. Rao or opt for Dr. Rao's experimental treatment. If Dr. Smith chooses Dr. Rao's experimental treatment, Dr. Rao then has to decide: if he maintains his experimental treatment, he will secure a -1 benefit and Dr. Smith will get 5; but if he switches back to Dr. Smith's standard treatment, their benefits would be -10 for Dr. Rao and 4 for Dr. Smith. In the final phase, Dr. Smith has the last choice; if she carries on with the experimental treatment, the benefits will be 4 for her and -10 for Dr. Rao, but if she reverts to her original standard treatment, both doctors get a personal gain of 5 and -1 respectively.

You are given a 2-player normal-form game.\n\nThe game is represented by two payoff matrices:\n- First matrix: Player 0's payoffs.\n- Second matrix: Player 1's payoffs.\n\nEach cell (i, j) gives the outcome when Player 0 plays i and Player 1 plays j.\nPlayer 0's payoff is the entry at [i][j] in the first matrix, and\nPlayer 1's payoff is the entry at [i][j] in the second matrix.\n\nYour task is to compute the **Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium (PTE)**:\n1. Find each player's **maximin guarantee** (the worst-case payoff) across all outcomes.\n2. Eliminate any outcome that does *not* Pareto-dominate those guarantees.\n3. Recompute the maximin on the remaining outcomes and repeat until only one outcome is left.\n\nOutput exactly the coordinate [i, j] of that remaining outcome.  If no PTE exists, output `[]`.\n\nFormat your answer strictly as:\n\\boxed{[i, j]}\nor\n\\boxed{[]}\n\nPlayer 0's payoff matrix:\n[[3, 7, 2], [1, 0, 5], [4, 6, 8]]\n\nPlayer 1's payoff matrix:\n[[1, 2, 3], [5, 7, 4], [0, 8, 6]]""}]","[[2, 1]]"
